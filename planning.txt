Init:
  - Load sprites
  - Create box objects
  - Display sprites according to box locations

Game loop:
  - Check for keyboard input
  - Set velocity based on keyboard input
  - Check collisions of pending position based on velocity
    - If no collision, reposition player box to this position
    - If collision, reposition player box at edge of colliding object
  - Update sprite to match new box location

Directional pieces:
  - Determine direction based on original xy position and subsequent xy position
  - If same direction as previous, age animation
  - If new direction, start new animation at random point
  - If no direction, change sprite to standing facing previous direction

Player walking:
  Down:
    25, 1, 25, 2
  Left:
    8, 7, 8, 33
  Up:
    5, 27, 6, 27
  Right:
    4, 3, 4, 34
Player striking:
  Down:
    18, 10
  Left:
    24, 16
  Up:
    30, 14
  Right:
    20, 12

Bush positions: [3, 6] = row-4-col-7.png; [4, 7] = row-5-col-8.png;
Grass position: [0, 5] = row-6-col-1.png;
Dirt position: [8, 8] = row-9-col-9.png;

Piece behaviors:
  - Player
  - Background: does not cause collision
  - Breakable: causes collision, can be broken (variable for durability, variable for drops)
  - Obstruction: causes collision, cannot be broken

Scene editor:
- New pixi state that handles stage clicks, animates pieces, and allows scrolling based on keyboard input
- Hook absolutely positioned on bottom of screen to hold piece types
- Iterate through piece types, creating a DOM container object for each, which holds the title and the graphic
- OnClick event in the DOM container which sets a selected piece type
- click event handler in the pixi state that replaces the clicked tile with a new piece
- Function to export created scenes as a two-dimensional array of indexes
- Function to import a scene for editing or play

Drawing large maps:
- Perform check every time enters a new grid space
- Find the new row/column about to be introduced to the viewport and the old row/column that has exited by calculating using the offset, screen size, and tile size
- Show/hide them respectively
- If necessary, remove the sprites that leave and create the ones that enter

Burst breaking:
- One bush in five twinkles
- With a set of five bush hits the twinkle with increase, then reset
- If a twinkle bush is hit on five within the set it will burst, breaking it and any bushes next to it
- If a twinkle bush is hit on one through four within the set the twinkles with dissipate, doing nothing

Planes:
- Dark, cozy forest with constant hunger
- Bright white and gold rocky land with flowing bright blue rivers and waterfalls
- Neon city with creatures that attack, cannot bring anything in
- Cloud-covered, floating sunset land where food grants flight
- Nighttime desert with glowing sands where food gives exponential strength

Other ideas:
- Devas which can perform work (harvesting, breeding) in exchange for food and a place to live (statue)
- The "Rambling Linguist" whose work can be found scattered around the planes and translates Deva language
