Init:
  - Load sprites
  - Create box objects
  - Display sprites according to box locations

Game loop:
  - Check for keyboard input
  - Set velocity based on keyboard input
  - Check collisions of pending position based on velocity
    - If no collision, reposition player box to this position
    - If collision, reposition player box at edge of colliding object
  - Update sprite to match new box location

Directional pieces:
  - Determine direction based on original xy position and subsequent xy position
  - If same direction as previous, age animation
  - If new direction, start new animation at random point
  - If no direction, change sprite to standing facing previous direction

Bush positions: [3, 6] = row-4-col-7.png; [4, 7] = row-5-col-8.png;
Grass position: [0, 5] = row-6-col-1.png;
Dirt position: [8, 8] = row-9-col-9.png;

Piece behaviors:
  - Player
  - Background: does not cause collision
  - Breakable: causes collision, can be broken (variable for durability, variable for drops)
  - Obstruction: causes collision, cannot be broken

Scene editor:
- New pixi state that handles stage clicks, animates pieces, and allows scrolling based on keyboard input
- Hook absolutely positioned on bottom of screen to hold piece types
- Iterate through piece types, creating a DOM container object for each, which holds the title and the graphic
- OnClick event in the DOM container which sets a selected piece type
- click event handler in the pixi state that replaces the clicked tile with a new piece
- Function to export created scenes as a two-dimensional array of indexes
- Function to import a scene for editing or play
